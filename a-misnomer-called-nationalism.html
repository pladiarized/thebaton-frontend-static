									<h4><em>Abstract</em></h4>
									<div class="vlt-gap-20"></div>

									The world is subsumed with people who intend to believe that they are the sole stakeholders, chosen by some divine power, to protect their faith, traditions, or religion. History has witnessed various communities assuming the solitary responsibility of sheltering their faith, irrespective of how radical their chosen methodologies might be. Often, these means go against the fundamental humanitarian ideals, and the world gets subjected to horrific episodes of destruction and genocide. An insatiable thirst of assuming the highest of authority is, indeed, insatiable. Be it the Nazi Revolution aiming to form a homogenous, political entity occupied only by people belonging to a certain "pure Aryan race" or the ongoing, seemingly, and arguably dormant Hindutva movement by the ruling political party of the Republic of India. The following paper attempts to answer the evergreen question of what secularism and communalism mean for the Indian population, especially against the backdrop of the rising Hindutva patriotism and pseudo-nationalism.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>A human is said to be a social animal. Since time immemorial, our civilisations have established themselves on the virtues of mutual co-operation and collaborative efforts. Be it the Roman Civilisation, Indus Valley civilisation, the Mayan Civilisation, or the Greeks, all of them emerged due to the division of labour and establishment of societies. In any society, people occupying the same geographical region or working in the same economic setup identify themselves as a part of that shared community. Anyone out of this entanglement is usually termed a foreigner, seemingly alien to their customs and traditions, more often than not, met with hostility and suspicion. This is the animalistic tendency of human nature that acts as a buttress for the "divide and rule" politics, utilising which the British empire rooted its hold over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for almost two centuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indian subcontinent, globally renowned for its unity in diversity<em>, </em>is a perfect amalgamation of people, following different religions, belonging to different class groups, associating themselves with different castes, carrying out different customs, and speaking different languages, while living in <em>harmony. </em>However, in a society as heterogenous as ours, this harmony is exceptionally fragile and requires constant caretaking. The subcontinent had sung the dream of freedom from the British rule through a collaborative spirit of combined struggle and unity amongst Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. Seventy years ago, our people were successful in acquiring this freedom. However, it did not come without a cost. The subcontinent was partitioned into Hindu-majority, India, and Muslim-majority, Pakistan, sparking one of the largest forced migration the world has ever seen, Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. Over 10 million people were on the move. Sectarian violence followed, with, up to a million people dying and tens of thousands of women abducted and raped. The feeling of "us" versus "them" strengthened even further, and the wicked forces found the Indian unity in the most vulnerable state possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partition generated memories, hatred, stereotypes, and identities that continue to shape the history of people on both sides of the border. What followed was an attempt to build a nation that promoted the ideals of individual liberty and secularism. However, in a country where community-based existence has been the backbone of the society and where the smallest brick of this societal setup is a family, promoting the infamous "western" notions of individualism was not effortless. Through the means of this paper, we will attempt to answer all these concerns, in addition to how the majoritarian ideals of Hinduism, and the rise of Hindutva ideologies, shaped the political environment, thereafter redefining secularism and communalism in the Indian context.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The feeling of "Us" vs "Them"&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Trust and unity played an immense role in the harmonious living of the varied groups of people in the subcontinental region. For centuries, the two majority religious communities of the country, Hindus, and Muslims had lived in peace under the dynastic rule of countless monarchs. Allegiances and adherence of people to their nation or government were never scrutinised to the degree that they hinder the enjoyment of anyone's fundamental rights. According to popular mistaken belief, the loyalty of the Muslim population lies with Pakistan. Thus, the religious community will never be able to accept the principles of Hindutva living (elaboration on this in further segments). The stereotype of the extra-territorial pan-Islamic loyalties comes fused with other highly objectionable ideas, as well. These ideas paint the Muslim population as cruel, bigoted, unclean, and descendants of invaders while Hindus as dark, cowardly, polytheist and lost beings. Though all these stereotypes predate the Partition era, they, indeed, strengthened and got cemented due to it. </p>
<p>The next step in widening the gap between "us" vs "them" comes with the practice of communalism. Communalism refers to a politics that seeks to unify one community around a religious identity in hostile opposition to another community. Communalism can be both-sided; it might nurture politics of hatred for an identified "other"- "Hindus" in the case of Muslim communalism, and "Muslims" in the case of Hindu communalism. This hatred goes on to feed the politics of violence. When combined with the ideals of Hindutva and Hindu Raj, this politicisation leads to pseudo or religious nationalism. In such an environment, any attempt to see a religious community as a "national identity" would mean sowing the seeds of antagonism against some other religion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assassinations of Indian activist Narendra Dabholkar, Comrade Govind Pansare, scholar M. M. Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh, all known to be rationalists in their approaches and staunch critics of the Hindu extremism spreading across the country, are vivid examples of how, when one authority assumes the sole responsibility to protect their radical faith and religion, it often leads to episodes of horrific tragedies which question the very existence of our sacred constitution and the democratic setup. In a world of extremisms, no one, whose ideals and beliefs stand in contrast to that of the majoritarian lens, can enjoy even their basic rights like freedom of speech and expression, or, looking at the cases mentioned earlier, right to life, for that matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up until the infamous national emergency, the political scenario, though occasionally tense and dynamic, was rarely of communal nature. Much of the criticisms or appraisals directed towards the six-time, General Elections winning (until the 1980s) political party of the country, the Indian National Congress, were based on their competency and objective in nature. It seemed like after decades, Indian politics had administered and healed the wounds left behind by the bloody partition. However, the era after the 1980s was the first time when the opposition started mobilising on the alleged Congress motives for the "appeasement of Muslims." This brought religion-based politics into the picture. </p>
<h4>Difference between Hinduism and Hindutva</h4>
<p>India from the early 1980s started witnessing the rise of politics based on religious identities. On Bhartiya Janata Party's initial failure to build its political career based on the principles of 'Gandhian Socialism,' the party began to emphasise on the Hindu nationalist elements by focusing on pursuing the politics of Hindutva. This they did by mobilising Hindus, especially those from upper caste economically stronger strata of the society. To understand what religion-based politics is, we will have to first define the ideology of Hindutva.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hindutva literally means "<em>hinduness</em>" and was defined by its originator, V. D. Savarkar, as the basis of Indian nationhood, which he said was synonymous with "Hindu nationhood" (Tharoor 143). The basic principles of Hindutva and the politics related to this ideology were based on three notions. It fundamentally meant that to be a member of the Indian, thus Hindu, nation, everyone must not only accept India as their fatherland (<em>pitrbhumi</em>) but also as their holy land (<em>punya bhumi</em>) (Tharoor 143). His argument was simple in the sense that he believed a strong nation could be built only based on a solid and united national, homogenous culture. In the case of India (because India is the birthplace of Hinduism), Hinduism was the only religion with the capabilities to "unite" every citizen under one umbrella. This form of political stifling leads to hatred of one community towards the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Hindutva focuses primarily on the mobilisation and extremist measures of a rather misguided political unity, which in turn leads to exclusion from the "other" (Muslims, in this case), Hinduism is more of an inward-directed faith. Hinduism primarily focuses on self-realization and not merely respects; however, it necessitates the ideals of secularism. It focuses on the union of the soul with the Absolute power. Hindutva, on the contrary, is an outward-directed concept with the objective of establishing and propagating social and cultural distinctions for political advantage. Tharoor has written that Hindutva, in fact, stands on the opposite side of what Hinduism, as a religion, promotes. He mentions that according to Swami Vivekananda, what should be seen as the strengths of Hinduism- its extraordinary eclecticism and diversity, its refusal to confine itself to the dogmas of a single holy book, its fluidity, the impossibility to define it down to homogenous 'Semitic' creed- is precisely what the <em>Hindutvavadis</em> or the <em>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</em> sees as its weakness (Tharoor 196).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is a widespread perception that history repeats its course. This is evidently visible when<em> Hindutvavadis</em> attempt to justify the assassination of the activists mentioned above, like Narendra Dabholkar and others, by condemning their rationalist ideals to be solely directed towards the appeasement of Muslims. This extremist majoritarian belief is what had led to the assassination of the father of our nation, Shri Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, in 1948. Late Govind Pansare had gone on record to say that the ideology that led to Mahatma Gandhi's assassination is the same that killed, and still kills, rationalists and journalists who believe in practising their fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression (Patwardhan, 2018, 0:14:45). According to the extremists, any opinion which goes against their chosen faith and ideology is "anti-national" and thus hostile to the sovereignty and existence of the "Hindu republic of India."</p>
<p>Secularism, hence, in the Indian context, takes an entirely different connotation altogether. The secularism, which has been asseverated and publicly acknowledged by the Indian politicians, runs on the principle of 'keeping apart from the religion.' This principle means to keep the governmental machinery entirely out of the equation and not in direct or indirect interaction with the religious matters of the citizens. However, whenever the government makes special provisions of reservation, or provisions to strengthen or support certain marginal sects or supressed religion-based/caste-based minorities, this principle stands purposeless. In such a scenario, the Indian government should observe the practice of 'not favouring any particular sect or faith' rather than 'maintaining a distance or keeping apart from all religions.' Tharoor has also acknowledged the same principle and termed 'secularism' a misnomer in the Indian context of profuse religiosity (142). He terms the latter idea as 'pluralism' and observes it as the Indian form of secularism (142).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The uncanny parallels from the second World War</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, as well, V.D. Savarkar believed that a strong nation could be built only based on a strong and united national, homogenous culture. Another man, immortal in the pages of history, once said that:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"The state is only the vessel, and the race is what it contains. The vessel can only have meaning if it preserves and safeguards the contents &hellip; The supreme purpose of the ethical state is to guard and preserve those racial elements (Hitler 358)."</em></p>
<p>The man was no one other than Adolf Hitler himself. The "state" that he talks about was Germany and the German-occupied territory during the second world war, and the race which the said state needs to protect was the pure <em>Aryan</em> race, which supposedly was in danger from the "impure" Jews. He had a very clear idea about the ethnic makeup of the nation. However, according to him, 'The state' was not an economic organisation; it was a 'volkic organism' (Weaver). Based on this principle, Hitler believed that the 'volkisch' concept separated mankind into races of superior and inferior quality (Hitler 348). He became successful in establishing the discourse of 'us' versus 'them', basing his argument on this racial hierarchy. This led to the formation of a new form of nationalism, nationalism based upon bloodlines and race. It stood exclusively contrary to the more inclusive form of nationalism, the civic nationalism. Civic nationalism bases its memberships upon mutual beliefs and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one observes closely, one cannot avoid drawing parallels of the fascist agendas during the second world war with the current political ecosystem in India. According to Prabhat Patnaik, the Hindutva movement, at least in the manner it has progressed, is almost, in a rudimentary sense, fascist in its ideologies, fascist in its class support, fascist in its methodologies, fascist in its programme (69). He compares the ingredients of the fascist ideology. He points out their presence in the radical Hindutva ideology being practised in the country: the attempt to unify the majority under a homogenised concept, 'the Hindus'; a sense of grievance against alleged injustices done to this homogeneous group in the past by an excluded homogeneous minority; a sense of cultural superiority; a reinterpretation of history exclusively in these terms; a total rejection of contrary evidence, of dispassionate analysis, of the scientific method of rational discourse; and above all an appeal to the so-called homogeneous majority in passionate, blood- curdling, and essentially male chauvinist terms to 'stand up,' 'assert their manhood,' 'show that it is blood, not water that flows in their veins,' all of which amount to an incitement to violence, and result in actual violence, against the minority group (Patnaik 69).</p>
<p>In fact, this form of toxic masculinity plays a part, and affects not just politics, but different aspects of our human living. Furthering, we will be discussing its impact on the violent acts of lynching and attempt to draw a parallel to the horrendous act of rape, virtually, and arguably, the "best" portrayal of this toxic masculinity.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A future beyond comprehension?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>It would be a grave injustice if we discuss communal politics and leave lynching out of the picture. Lynching is not just a mere murder. In the words of Aparna Vaidik, lynching, where a mob captures, drags, maims, and hangs another human, is very much like a gang rape in its symbolism (117).</p>
<p>The heinous crime of rape is rarely solely about the sexual pleasure and more about the inherently atrocious social conditioning which teaches men in our societies that they are intrinsically dominating in nature. It teaches men that the only way to practise and showcase their masculinity is to acquire complete control over the situation and, hence, over the bodies of others. It is more about the violence and the insecurities associated with it than the carnal nature of the act. Transferring the discussion, even the act of lynching is seldom about the circumstances that are present at that time, and more about the protection of one's believes and faith. The "stakeholders" actively demonstrate the fragility of their faith, like the rapist depicts the fragility of his masculinity, and commits actions that glue the cracks, keeps their insecurities taped, and holds it together on a momentary basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynching is a form of collective, retributive justice that the majority community carries out in the name of righting the historical injustice (Vaidik 117). It is a public demonstration and hailed as a spectacle of the supposed moral superiority of the majoritarian community, especially in the Indian context. Often, the majoritarian community resorts to this act and uses it as a weapon against caste and religious minorities. They do so in the name of restoring their honour. The "beef vigilante" groups polluting and populating every nook and corner of the city streets have started using it as a legitimate customary practice. India is gradually becoming indifferent to, or tolerant of the violence because of its excess. Every episode of lynching on religious lines entrenches the Hindu supremacist sense. The sense paints the <em>Hindu</em> as a historical victim, criminalising the minority religious and caste communities. Vaidik writes that at the core of every lynching is the Hindu fear of the lustful Dalit or Muslim man, who is after the Hindu cow and Hindu women (i.e., enacting love jihad). The supposed victim is the Hindu supremacist, whose woman, as if his property, was and still is, allegedly being violated for centuries (121). Under Hindutva rule, thus, violence has been freely expressed, propagated, and justified in the name of enacting social justice.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Tantamount to rape, if the society has to fight the evils of lynching and communal assassinations, and if the society wants to build an environment where each individual has the most supreme of all rights, the human right of allowance to every individual to actually put in practise the enjoyment of their fundamental and other legal rights, we as the members of this society will have to make striving efforts to make it happen. The current model of the society would require a complete revamping. This revamping needs to start at the grass-root levels. Education plays a significant role in this regard. Virtues of harmonious living and accommodation need to be taught to our citizens, from a very early age, rather than teaching them to take charge and offense over menial issues and demonstrate the "manly man" they are by dominating the situations which do not require them intervening. It is truly despicable for them to believe that their faith, their customs, necessitate them to go through leaps and bounds to provide it with protection, often adopting radical methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A system of checks and balances, interspersed with measures for accountability from the ruling government, is a pressing need of the hour. A party that has acquired a majority in both the house of the government and manages to form government in various states of the country has imperceptible authority, and equally high chances of misusing these powers if its intentions are not set in the right path. Democracy is for the people of the people and, most importantly, by the people. This means that the democratic ideas are only as cemented as the citizens of that country strive, every day, for them to be. Overthrowing an elected representative setup is not impossible, and a domineering, authoritative figure can do so at the first opportunity it gets. Our faith, our religion, is not what needs our protection; however, our democratic setup and our sacred constitution do. </p>
